App Todo List

Priorities 

1. Deep Linking
    Allow us to link to pages within the app using normal qr codes, instead of having to scan them within the app

2. Image Gallery
    Create a rotating image galley component for exhibit pages
    Users should be able to pan forwards and backwards
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-snap-carousel
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-image-gallery#scroll-state-and-events


3. Interactive Map
    Get access to high quality images of the center Map
    Create annotation components to give additional information about exhibits and link to exhibit pages

4. Movies
    Get access to movie schedule and descriptions for movies page

5. Create article page formats and global styles
    https://chabotspace.org/visit/exhibits/the-nasa-experience/
    (Feb Meeting have three teams each make a page for each exhibit)

6. Fix Calendar.tsx such that it does not crash the app

Later



1. Fix audio player (which may or may not be used)
2. Generally make everything look prettier ()
3. Translations of museum content (we will get Translations given to us, but we will have to be able to switch out to the translated versions)
